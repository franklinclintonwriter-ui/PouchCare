### PR-0.1 — Ledger scaffold
- **Branch:** `ent/p0-ledger` → `enterprise/main`
- **What:** Added the persistent progress ledger and contribution scaffolding:
  `docs/ROADMAP.md` (static plan), `docs/PROGRESS.md` (living checklist + RESUME block),
  `docs/ledger/PR-INDEX.md` (this file), `.github/pull_request_template.md`,
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/enterprise-task.md` (Copilot brief).
- **Decisions:** Branching = `enterprise/main` + stacked `ent/p{phase}-{slug}`. Seed prod
  once after Phase 2 (recommended) so additive Phase-2 schema folds into `0_init`.
- **Deferred / out-of-scope:** CI ledger-presence guard lands in PR-0.3 (alongside the
  green typecheck baseline).
- **Follow-ups:** none.
